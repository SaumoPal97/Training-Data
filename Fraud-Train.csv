The Fodder Scam was a corruption scandal that involved the embezzlement of about ₹9.4 billion from the government treasury of the eastern Indian state of Bihar.,fraud
"As of May 2013, the trial has completed in 44 cases out of a total of 53 cases.More than 500 accused have been convicted and awarded punishments by various courts.",fraud
"Among those implicated in the theft and arrested were then Chief Minister of Bihar, Lalu Prasad Yadav, as well as former Chief Minister, Jagannath Mishra.",fraud
The scandal led to the end of Lalu's reign as Chief Minister. There is also allegation on Shivanand Tiwari of receiving 1 crore and 60 lakh Rupees respectively from S.N. Sinha.,fraud
"The theft spanned for many years, and allegedly involved numerous Bihar state's administrative and elected officials across multiple administrations of the Indian National Congress and the Janata Dal parties. ",fraud
"The corruption scheme involved the fabrication of ""vast herds of fictitious livestock"" for which fodder, medicines and animal husbandry equipment was supposedly procured.",fraud
"Although the scandal broke in 1996, the theft had been in progress, and increased in size, for over two decades.",fraud
" Besides the magnitude and duration of the theft, the scam was and continues to be covered in Indian media due to the extensive nexus between tenured bureaucrats, elected politicians and businesspeople that it revealed, and as an example of the mafia raj that has penetrated several state-run economic sectors in the country.",fraud
"Since it broke into public light, the fodder scam has become symbolic of bureaucratic corruption and the criminalisation of politics in India generally, and in Bihar in particular.",fraud
" It has been called a symptom of the ""deep and chronic malady afflicting the Bihar government and quite a few other state governments as well.""",fraud
" In the Indian parliament, it was cited as an important indicator of the deep inroads made by mafia raj in the politics and economics of the country.",fraud
"Reference has also been made to the anarchic nature of governance (the ""withering away of the state"") that occurs when a mafia develops in a state-controlled sector of the economy.",fraud
"A technical support scam (often abbreviated tech support scam) refers to class of telephone fraud activities, in which a scammer claims to offer a legitimate technical support service, often via cold calls to unsuspecting users.",fraud
" Such cold calls are mostly targeted at Microsoft Windows users, with the caller often claiming to represent a Microsoft technical support department.",fraud
"In English-speaking countries such as the United States, United Kingdom and Australia, such cold call scams have occurred as early as 2008 and primarily originate from call centers in India.",fraud
Technical support scams typically rely on social engineering.,fraud
" Remote desktop software is used to connect to the victim's computer, and the scammer then uses a variety of confidence tricks that employ various Windows components and utilities (such as the Event Viewer), third-party utilities (such as rogue security software), and other tasks to make the victim believe that the computer has issues that need to be fixed, before proceeding for the victim to pay for ""support"".",fraud
"These tricks are meant to target victims who may be unfamiliar with the actual uses of these tools, such as inexperienced users and senior citizens—especially when the scam is initiated by a cold call.",fraud
"They then coax the victim into paying for their services or the software designed to ""repair"" their computer, and in turn, gain access to the victim's credit card information, which can be used to make additional fraudulent charges. ",fraud
"Afterwards, the scammer may also claim that the victim is eligible for a refund, and request the user's bank account information—which is instead used to steal more money from the victim, rather than providing the promised refund.",fraud
"In an investigation conducted by Symantec employee Orla Cox, it was revealed that after Cox paid for the fee for the scammer to remove the nonexistent ""malware"" infections, the scammers would then merely clear the log in the Event Viewer and disable Windows' event logging feature.",fraud
" This merely means that errors would no longer appear in the Event Viewer, i.e. had malware actually existed on Cox's computer, it would remain intact.",fraud
"The great majority of the complaints and discussion about ""companies"" that cold-call and offer ""technical support"" report them as being not merely incompetent or ineffective, but actively dishonest, doggedly trying to convince the victim of non-existent problems by trickery, and when possible damaging a computer they gain access to.",fraud
"Computer support companies advertise on search engines like Google and Bing, but some are heavily criticised, sometimes for practices similar to the cold callers. ",fraud
"One example is the India-based company iYogi, which has been reported by InfoWorld to use scare tactics and install undesirable software. In December 2015, the state of Washington sued iYogi's US operations for scamming consumers and making false claims in order to scare the users into buying their diagnostic software",fraud
".iYogi, which was required to respond formally by the end of March 2016,said before its response that the lawsuit filed was without merit. ",fraud
"In September 2011, Microsoft dropped Comantra, a Gold Partner, from their Microsoft Partner Network because of accusations of being involved in cold-call technical support scams.",fraud
"In December 2014, Microsoft filed a lawsuit against a California-based company operating such scams for ""misusing Microsoft's name and trademarks"" and ""creating security issues for victims by gaining access to their computers and installing malicious software, including a password grabber that could provide access to personal and financial information.""",fraud
"In an effort to protect consumers, Microsoft-owned advertising network Bing Ads (which services ad sales on Bing and Yahoo! Search engines) amended its terms of service in May 2016 to prohibit the advertising of third-party technical support services or ads claiming to ""provide a service that can only be provided by the actual owner of the products or service advertised"".",fraud

Telemarketing fraud is fraudulent selling conducted over the telephone. The term is also used for telephone fraud not involving selling.,fraud
"This allows criminals to commit identity theft, assuming the identity of a consumer to make unauthorized purchases.",fraud
"Telemarketing scammers communicate with potential victim by telephone. They pitch products or services in order to persuade consumers to make a purchase, getting the victim to hand over credit card details and other information. ",fraud
Telemarketing fraud is one of the most persuasive deceptions identified by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).,fraud
"Telemarketing fraud often involves some sort of victim compliance: the victim may initiate contact with the perpetrator, or they may voluntarily provide private information to the offender. Thus fraud victims may experience feelings of shame and embarrassment that could prevent them from reporting their victimization.",fraud
Older people are disproportionately targeted by fraudulent telemarketers and make up an estimated 80% of victims affected by telemarketing scams. ,fraud
"Older people may be targeted because scammers assume they are more trusting, are too polite to hang up, or have a nest egg.",fraud
"Advance fee fraud – They will typically require upfront payments in exchange for goods and services. This is also a popular technique used in lottery and student scholarships scams. Once you have provided your personal information, the fraudsters will ask you to pay various fees – for example: taxes, legal fees, banking fees, etc. – so that they can release your non-existent winnings.",fraud
"Pyramid Schemes – Work by recruiting “members” to invest into a scheme. Most of the money is made by recruiting new members and a prime characteristic of the scam is the product is of little value. The people at the bottom of the pyramid pay the people at the top. Inevitably they will run out of new recruits and the scheme will collapse.Some individuals may profit from pyramid schemes, but the vast majority of those who join later on in the scheme will not.",fraud
"Credit Card Fraud – Fraudsters will call with promises to repair their credit ratings, provide credit options or credit facilities, credit cards with zero or very low interest, or instant and unlimited loans without credit checks or security. Such offers, if followed up, tend to come at a considerable cost to victims in terms of high interest rates or exorbitant fees. It is common for scammers to target people who have bad credit and are therefore more susceptible to take the offer in hopes to pay off debts or to increase their credit rating.
",fraud
"Overpayment fraud - One of the most popular scams making the rounds. A generous overpayment is made to the victim typically using a fake cheque. This can vary in goods but is popular among online auctions or classifieds. But before the cheque has been cleared by a bank and the victim discovers that the cheque has bounced, the scammer will request to have the difference refunded. Usually through an online banking transfer, pre-loaded money card, or a wire transfer such as Western Union. Therefore, victims lose both the money they send along with the item itself .
",fraud
"Charity Fraud – Telemarketers claiming to represent charities call asking you for a donation. Fake charities try to take advantage of people’s generosity and compassion for others in need. Scammers will steal the money by posing as a genuine charity They may even try to use recent events, such as natural disasters, to make their phony pleas for donations sound more believable.These scammers use aggressive high pressure techniques made to make the victim feel guilty or selfish if they do not want to donate.
",fraud
"Cramming – Small charges that are secretly inserted into customer’s credit card bills for services they did not order, buried so deep in credit card bills that many do not notice,usually with fake fees by vague financial services. Sometimes a one-time charge for entertainment services will be crammed onto phone bills. Other times it may be a recurring monthly charge. Cramming of recurring charges falls into two general categories: club memberships, such as psychic clubs, personal clubs, or travel clubs; and telecommunications products or service programs, such as voice mail, paging, and calling cards.
",fraud
"Summer Jobs Fraud – Much like an advance fee fraud, these scams are aimed at teenagers or young adults looking for work over the summer period. Telemarketers seek out the victims by scanning student job searches. The telemarketer will then claim the victim has been singled out and specially selected to be hired for a particular job. But before they can start work they are told to have to pay various fees to cover training, materials and insurance. When they eventually realize the job is a scam, it is already too late, they have lost the money they paid for in fees as well as the time it would take to find a new job.
",fraud
"Office supply scam – A very common scam where a telemarketer will target business managers responsible for purchasing office supplies, falsely representing their identity and the cost of office supplies – the most popular being toner.The caller might mislead a company’s employees into thinking that an order for office supplies has already been placed, either by an existing or former colleague, and that they are calling to chase up a signature for the order form to help them keep complete records. The company is then invoiced for unwanted, and overpriced, stationery and office supplies.
",fraud
"Magazine Subscriptions Scam - Scammers call victims with an intriguing offer and that for a small payment they can get a yearly subscription to their favorite magazine, even though they have no affiliation with the magazine's publisher. When victims agree, the scammers will send random magazines with grossly inflated prices. Another way they extract money is by falsely telling callers it is time to renew their magazine subscriptions in an attempt to get their credit or bank account information.",fraud
"Caller ID spoofing - Allows the caller to present any number they want to put up on the screen including existing numbers while keeping the real number they call from to remain private. Caller I.D. spoofing is a low cost option to help ensure anonymity.The same devices can also change voices to sound like a male or female.
",fraud
"Robo calls - Technology has made it cheap and easy for robo callers to make calls from anywhere in the world.[20] Most of these calls originate overseas, many in boiler rooms in India, and they are surprisingly effective.Robocalls have been used for legitimate campaigning and public opinion polling, but have also been used for vote suppression, false endorsements, and negative campaigning that borders on fraud. The federal regulatory regime currently excludes political robocalls from most telemarketing regulations. Presidential campaigns and national interest groups have accidentally violated state laws in trying to communicate with voters by using robocalls.
",fraud
"Crawler devices - The majority of fraudulent calls originate from Nigerian phone scammers, who claim a whopping $12.7 billion a year off phone scams.Some callers have to make up to 1000 calls per day. So to help with speeding things up they will sometimes use crawler devices which are computerized to go through every area code calling each and every number. If the caller does not reach, they mark the lead as ""no answer"" and the system change's it so they get called again a few days later. If the company does not have a large lead pool, they may get called as soon as 12 hours later. As with email spammers, they know that a certain proportion of their hits will score.
",fraud
"False Identity – Fraudulent Telemarketers use aliases to cover their tracks and prevent detection from the law. Some fraudulent telemarketers are deliberately located in other countries, as it is more difficult for law enforcement agencies to pursue them. Typically, scammers will use common western names in a bid to reassure callers they are calling from the same country",fraud
"Every year consumers lose billion of dollars due to fraudulent telemarketers, according to data from the ‘National Fraud Information Centre (NFIC)’ (“Congress acts on telemarketing fraud,” 1994).
",N/F
"To avoid becoming a victim of telemarketing fraud, an individual should not give out personal information such as credit card or bank account details or social security numbers over the telephone. If consumers are interested in a caller’s product or service, they should request more information be sent in the mail..",N/F
"This scam is most often tried on visitors arriving at Delhi airport who attempt to take a pre-paid taxi their hotel. During the journey, the driver will say that he doesn’t know where your hotel is (or that it’s full, or doesn’t exist) and offer to take you to another hotel, or a travel agent who can find you a hotel.

",fraud
"Many people end up falling for this scam as they’re tired from their flight and overwhelmed by the onslaught of India for the first time. Make sure you insist on being taken to the hotel that you planned to stay in. In addition, in Delhi don’t give the pre-paid taxi voucher to the driver until he does so. The driver requires this voucher in order to receive his payment from the taxi office for the trip. ",fraud
"This is a common scam that you are likely to experience all over India, but most often around tourist destinations in major cities.",fraud
" In Delhi, travelers looking for the International Tourist Bureau/Passenger Reservation Center at New Delhi Railway Station are often told that it's closed or has moved. ",fraud
